# Specification
**Our goal is to create an organizational platform (initially as a command-line interface, then as an Android app) that helps university students coordinate their everyday routine, from schoolwork and expenses to their personal life.** Users are able to track their events and deadlines to fit their personal needs, by the means of a calendar (that offers a monthly/weekly view) and a to-do list (displays events, for which the user can check to complete tasks). Our platform focuses on three main categories:

+ **Schoolwork:** As a user, I can add/edit/view/delete (use case) four school-related events (entity), including assessments, due dates, class times, and study sessions.

+ **Life:** As a user, I can add/edit/view/delete (use case) events (entity) covering four personal matters, including social events, work, and holidays.

+ **Entities.Expenses:** As a user, I can budget my monthly expenses (entity) by updating my income monthly and inputting my monthly expenses to see how much I have left (use case), by adding up all the expenses and subtracting that by the monthly income. I will get notified when my monthly budget is about to run out (when I have only 3% of my monthly budget remaining).

Upon app launch, users see the today view, which covers all current responsibilities and events in a form of a to-do list, allowing users to check off completed tasks. This landing page also features a menu that allows the user to view one of the three categories (mentioned above) to alter/view events.
