#Specification (Updated)

Plannr an organizational platform in the form of an Android app that helps university students coordinate their everyday routine, including schoolwork and expenses. Users are first asked to sign up by entering their full name, university they attend, email and password. After signing up users are able to track their events and deadlines, by the means of a calendar that offers a monthly view and a to-do list that displays events that are to be done today. Our platform currently focuses on two main categories:
Schoolwork: As a user, I can add (use case) four school-related events (entity), including assessments, due dates, class times, and study sessions.
Expenses: As a user, I can view my all-time expenses (entity) in the form of list showing the name of the expense and the amount of money spend.  By going to the add expenses page and inputting the name of the expense and the amount of dollars I can add an expense to the expense list.
Upon app launch, users see the today view, which covers all current responsibilities and events in a form of a to-do list, that displays the current date on top. This landing page also features a side menu that allows the users to view one of the two categories (mentioned above) to add/view events. In addition, there is a settings page that allows the user to change their name and university at any point in time.
